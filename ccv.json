Our group is a very energetic young group comprised of young adults ranging from their 20's to mid 30's. We love this dynamic because a lot of us are in the same walk of life... newly married, newly parents, first job, far from family, etc... and because of this we are able to connect on a much deeper level. We are a great group that loves to get to know each and every individual on a personal basis and find out how we can help serve them in their spiritual journey with Christ. Typically we meet every Monday night at 7:00pm (but to be honest we don't typically get started until about 7:30-7:45). We then begin our study which is either a video series provided by CCV church that we choose depending on the interest of the group OR we have done direct scripture studies of whole books of the Bible. Following the study we discuss and wrap things up with prayer which usually occurs around 8:30PM. From there it's back to hanging out and community time until you need to leave. We have a very open house policy... mi casa su casa... and you will notice this right away with people bringing dinner to eat or cooking in our kitchen before study. We also have a wonderful puppy Wrigley who is a golden retriever and will be roaming around the house during study typically looking for anyone willing to scratch her. She is sweet, gentle and would not harm a fly. Aside from the studies we also will break every now and then to have game nights, group dinners, movie night or just hang out and watch a big game on that night. We are a very close group and welcome anyone in this walk of life looking to connect with other young adults and grow closer to Christ.","GroupCampus":"Scottsdale","City":"Phoenix","State":"AZ","Latitude":33.66223,"Longitude":-112.00149,"DayOfWeek":"Monday","TimeOfDay":"7:00 PM","FriendlyScheduleText":"Monday at 7:00 PM","CoachFirstName":"Payton","CoachLastName":"Leonhardt","CoachPhotoId":880197,"AllCoaches":"Payton Leonhardt,","GroupMemberStatus":"NotInGroup","Childcare":false,"OnlineGroup":false,"AtCapacity":false,"FamilyPicture":""},{"Id":1915245,"CCVGroupType":"Neighborhood Group","CCVGroupAudience":"Everyone Welcome","Name":"Chris and Emily Fahrenholz' Group","Description":"Our group is a mix of ages ranging from young singles to families of young kids.

We are very excited and welcome whatever stage you are in your faith as everyone has a story to tell.  \n\nConnecting with group 7pm - 8:30pm  with Pot Luck style appetizers/snacks/desserts to share with everyone. \n\nWe are and have been meeting in Person as we need connection and social interaction with other believers.  Every week has a different capacity. Some weeks we have 8 people other times we may have 20. We understand things come up and you may not be able to make it. We feel anyone nearby should have an opportunity to connect in homes.","GroupCampus":"Anthem","City":"Phoenix","State":"AZ","Latitude":33.81229,"Longitude":-112.12467,"DayOfWeek":"Wednesday","TimeOfDay":"7:00 PM","FriendlyScheduleText":"Wednesday at 7:00 PM","CoachFirstName":"Rich","CoachLastName":"Mortensen","CoachPhotoId":1222246,"AllCoaches":"Tanya Tomasso,Rich Mortensen,","GroupMemberStatus":"NotInGroup","Childcare":false,"OnlineGroup":false,"AtCapacity":true,"FamilyPicture":"78c26a66-5953-46c2-96eb-081153e2be5f"},{"Id":2701791,"CCVGroupType":"Neighborhood Group","CCVGroupAudience":"Everyone Welcome","Name":"Ben & Genea Kreger's Group","Description":"","GroupCampus":"Anthem","City":"Anthem","State":"AZ","Latitude":33.84764,"Longitude":-112.13176,"DayOfWeek":"Sunday","TimeOfDay":"6:00 PM","FriendlyScheduleText":"Sunday at 6:00 PM","CoachFirstName":"Ben","CoachLastName":"Kreger","CoachPhotoId":null,"AllCoaches":"Genea Kreger,Ben Kreger,","GroupMemberStatus":"NotInGroup","Childcare":false,"OnlineGroup":false,"AtCapacity":false,"FamilyPicture":""},{"Id":2653535,"CCVGroupType":"Neighborhood Group","CCVGroupAudience":"Everyone Welcome","Name":"Sycamore Farms Group","Description":"We welcome people of all backgrounds and ages (married couples, singles, young families) to gather weekly for fun, fellowship and discussion.

Charlie & Amber here, nice to e-meet you all! :) We are in our mid-to-late 20’s (y’know that millennial life trying to tackle this whole #adulting business). And are extremely excited about launching our brand new group in downtown Phoenix! We believe God has great things planned for this community and we hope to just play a part in that. Amber is from LA and is a fashion / lifestyle producer & digital content creator. Charlie is from Detroit and is a sports producer & reporter. We’re both recent transplants to this beautiful desert city that we call home! And yes, we loooove everything about Phoenix! We love Jesus, traveling, trying new foods, exploring other cultures, spending quality time with each other and family, watching Detroit sports together (yes LA sometimes, too, but it’s an in-house rivalry-it’s all good), attending events around town, hiking, and checking out different restaurants & coffee shops. \n\nYOU are invited as we will focus our discussions & studies around young married couples walking through this journey called life together! We know this season of life is a huge blessing and we want to be able to provide a space for those going through that similar young married season of life, knowing you’re not going through it alone. We all go through struggles and want to be a place where we can talk through stuff and point each other back to Christ as He protects us to live the lives we’re called to live—and want to be a group that HAS FUN, grows in our faith in Christ, loves our neighbors as Jesus loves us, and hopefully Kingdom builds by transforming the Valley for Jesus via our actions, serving others in the community, praying, and breaking bread (or pizza) together!","GroupCampus":"Midtown Phoenix","City":"Phoenix","State":"AZ","Latitude":33.46453,"Longitude":-112.0738,"DayOfWeek":"Tuesday","TimeOfDay":"7:00 PM","FriendlyScheduleText":"Tuesday at 7:00 PM","CoachFirstName":"Charlie","CoachLastName":"Lapastora","CoachPhotoId":1317294,"AllCoaches":"Stephanie Graffious,Derek Graffious,Amber Lapastora,Charlie Lapastora,","GroupMemberStatus":"NotInGroup","Childcare":false,"OnlineGroup":false,"AtCapacity":true,"FamilyPicture":"52d49586-7f4d-453f-8e9e-091ca969e112"},{"Id":2203644,"CCVGroupType":"Neighborhood Group","CCVGroupAudience":"Everyone Welcome","Name":"Josh and Tessa Olivas' Group","Description":"","GroupCampus":"Midtown Phoenix","City":"Phoenix","State":"AZ","Latitude":33.51491,"Longitude":-112.05462,"DayOfWeek":"Tuesday","TimeOfDay":"6:30 PM","FriendlyScheduleText":"Tuesday at 6:30 PM","CoachFirstName":"Josh","CoachLastName":"Olivas","CoachPhotoId":1328273,"AllCoaches":"Josh Olivas,","GroupMemberStatus":"NotInGroup","Childcare":false,"OnlineGroup":false,"AtCapacity":true,"FamilyPicture":"0e56ec95-b1d2-4276-a8b2-36c98ce9545e"},{"Id":2696608,"CCVGroupType":"Neighborhood Group","CCVGroupAudience":"Couples","Name":"Danny Sanchez' Group","Description":"Danny Sanchez' Group","GroupCampus":"Midtown Phoenix","City":"Peoria","State":"AZ","Latitude":33.55852,"Longitude":-112.24766,"DayOfWeek":"Tuesday","TimeOfDay":"7:00 PM","FriendlyScheduleText":"Tuesday at 7:00 PM","CoachFirstName":"Danny","CoachLastName":"Sanchez","CoachPhotoId":1326114,"AllCoaches":"Danny Sanchez,","GroupMemberStatus":"NotInGroup","Childcare":false,"OnlineGroup":false,"AtCapacity":false,"FamilyPicture":""},{"Id":2640233,"CCVGroupType":"Neighborhood Group","CCVGroupAudience":"Everyone Welcome","Name":"Mark and Kelly Barnhart's Group","Description":"Mark and I have been married and living in the Sunnyslope area for the last 15 years.

Caregivers of people with a chronic illness are often the forgotten one, not by the patient, but by everyone else. Rightfully so, questions are often asked about how the patient is doing. Rarely does it seem anyone asks how the caregiver is doing. Caregivers take on extra responsibilities and this often leads to extra stress. This can lead to breakdown of the caregiver, feelings of anger, resentment, bitterness, and temptation to throw in the towel and give up. Relationships often come to the brink of destruction. But there is hope and His name is Jesus. He is the source of our strength. He cares! This group will provide caregivers the listening ear from fellow caregivers. It will strengthen their resolve and rejuvenate them to keep fighting the good fight. It will help them take their focus off themselves and place it on Jesus, which in turn will renew their spirit to lovingly and unselfishly give care to the patient.

How can you fix it? Therapy or pills? No. \n\"Can't Hurt Me\" is about how vulnerability is where the strength is. Some people called me \"crazy\" or told me I can't do it(rightfully so, I weighed 260lbs, just divorced and bankrupt. There was more proof against me than for me) I said *&^% you and ran my first marathon Jan. 2019. I finished with blisters on the bottom my feet the size of 50cent piece, I was so *&^$ sore and I couldn't move for two days.  I was so proud because I earned this pain and did something at 49 my friends didn't think I'd do. Then in March 2019 I ran a 32 mile race with 7,000 feet of vertical 8 hrs. Then another in September 2019 another 32 miler  7,700 vertical At Mt. Saint Helens (pic above) & sprained my ankle 2 minutes into race then kept running for 9 hrs until medical staff stopped me at final aid station 26 miles in. Then this September, 2020 64 miles 19 hrs 36 min.  I’m not telling you these things to brag, I started not being able to walk 2 miles!

Excuses make you common!  \nJesus says, \"seek me and you'll find me.\"  I tried everything to \"seek him\" but all I got was frustrated and pissed off. No hope will produce anger in your life.

Living “UNCOMMON AMONGST UNCOMMON” might not be for everyone, some people want comfort and warmth! That’s ok! I’m looking for other warriors looking for more out of life. \nWhen I reach heaven I want to know I did everything I could to get closer to Jesus, I want him to know I would push and beat my body harder than I ever thought just to \"seek his face\" and then kneel as a \"Warrior to his King.\"\nIt takes work and a lot of it.
