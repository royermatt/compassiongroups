We have enjoyed three amazing books. Love Like That, taught us to love like Jesus. Get Out of Your Head helped us learn to take negative thoughts captive, quit spiraling down, and tooled us to spiral up. If taught us we can live and be amazed enjoying the what if dreams & tasks God has purposed for us. Beginning January 5th we will begin a new study, Celebrating Jesus In The Biblical Feast. The Feasts of the Lord have powerful and prophetic significance to all of us. Each Feast is a picture of Jesus the Messiah and represents one of the seven phases of spiritual development in your life. I can’t express how excited I am to study this with you!",
